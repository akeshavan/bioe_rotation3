Multiband factor?\n* Motion sensitivity: reference scans mess things up\n  * get better basis sets - track movement of head\n\n##### DIffusion MRI\n* Sensory processing disorder\n  * unusual behavioral responses to sensory stuff -- autism & ADHD, premature infants and fragile X\n  * abnormal wm microstructure\n\n#####Spectroscopy\n* slice selective inversion recovery",
